# Translating generated image captions from English to Bangla

Bangla is the seventh most spoken language in the world, and the language behind the celebration of International Language Day. 

In this project, we tried to give it more technical relevance in the world of deep learning, by combining a caption generating transformer model and the Google API in a pipeline. The pipeline takes in an image as an input and produces a Bangla caption as output. The model was trained on the Flickr8k dataset, and evaluated using the BLEU metric against the Bangla reference captions provided by Saiful, Faiyaz Khan and Shifath Rahman on Kaggle for the same dataset.
